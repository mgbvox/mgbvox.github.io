In collaboration with the village of [Naknek](https://www.travelalaska.com/Destinations/Communities/Naknek.aspx), the [Camai Community Health Center](https://camaichc.org/), [Alaska State government](http://dhss.alaska.gov/), and [Cue Health](https://cuehealth.com/), we modernized the COVID tracking system for healthcare in the area, catering to over 10,000 fisherwomen and men and saving thousands of hours of labor. Uniquely, as Naknek has limited internet connectivity, our system is designed to work equally well online and offline.
