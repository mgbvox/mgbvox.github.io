In collaboration with the village of Naknek, Alaska State government, and Cue Health, we modernized the COVID tracking system for healthcare in the area, catering to over 10,000 fishermen and women and saving thousands of hours of labor. Uniquely, as Naknek has limited internet connectivity, our system is designed to work equally well online and offline.
